## About Us
We are a team of passionate senior computer science students dedicated to improving the usage of image enhancement experience. Our diverse backgrounds in software development, design, AI, and user experience help us create innovative solutions for real-world problems.

## Project Description
In the digital age, images have become central to communication, documentation, and creative expression. However, existing image editing tools often fall short in meeting the diverse needs of users. Many platforms either offer a limited range of features or require significant technical expertise.

**OptiVim-o** (Optical Visual Modulator and Organizer) is an all-in-one, AI-powered image enhancement platform that bridges this gap by combining deep learning and modern computer vision techniques with an intuitive interface. The platform supports a variety of advanced features, designed to cater to both professional and casual users.

### Core Features

1. **Image Resize**  
   Enabling users to resize images to custom dimensions or reduce file size intelligently without quality loss‚Äîusing interpolation techniques and smart resizing algorithms.

2. **Format Conversion**  
   Support for image format transformations across JPEG, PNG, BMP, and other common types, improving compatibility and storage optimization.

3. **Image Rotation**  
   Allows fine-grained rotation by any degree to correct orientation or apply creative effects, with support for anti-aliasing and bilinear interpolation.

4. **Colorization**  
   Revives grayscale or black-and-white images through deep learning-based automatic colorization, offering realistic tones and historically plausible palettes.

5. **Image Summarization**  
   Uses AI to extract semantic content from an image and summarize it in natural language‚Äîcombining computer vision and NLP techniques.

6. **Noise Removal**  
   Utilizes deep denoising networks to remove various types of noise (Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, etc.) while preserving details in low-quality or compressed images.

7. **Image Restoration**  
   Repairs old or damaged images through intelligent inpainting, removing scratches, stains, and aging artifacts to recover original aesthetics.

8. **Image Super-Resolution**  
   Enhances low-resolution images through AI-powered upscaling techniques like SRCNN or ESRGAN to improve clarity and detail.

9. **Background Removal**  
   Leverages semantic segmentation to separate foreground subjects with high accuracy, enabling creative reusability of visual elements.

10. **Age Manipulation**  
    Applies age progression or regression effects using GAN-based facial transformation models for natural and photorealistic edits.

### Additional Features

11. **Generative Fill (Outpainting)**  
    Extends image borders by filling in missing or expanded areas using diffusion models. Ideal for artwork expansion and creative extensions.

12. **Object Removal**  
    Detects and removes unwanted objects or individuals using inpainting techniques to intelligently reconstruct the background.

13. **Object Recolor**  
    Allows users to recolor specific objects like clothing or accessories while preserving shading, lighting, and texture.

14. **Cartoon Stylization**  
    Converts images into cartoon-like illustrations using neural style transfer. Perfect for avatars and creative visuals.

15. **Pixel Art Conversion**  
    Transforms standard images into retro-style pixel art. Great for game developers and digital artists.

16. **Pixel Art Background and Character Generation**  
    Automatically generates pixel art assets from regular images‚Äîideal for games, animations, and storytelling media.

17. **Contrast Enhancement**  
    Improves contrast and brightness using histogram equalization and adaptive machine-learned filters based on content.
